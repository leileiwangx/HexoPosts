## Speculating 作出推测
In some exams, you have to talk about what you can see in a picture and speculate about the situation or a wider issue prompted by the picture. These are ways of saying what you think might be the case. 考试中有时需要谈论图画内容并据此就其情境或更广泛的问题作出推测，可使用以下表达方式：
- I think it’s likely that these people know each other. 
我认为这些人可能彼此认识。
- I imagine she’s his wife. 
我猜她是他的妻子。
- They might/may/could be related.(BrE or formal, NAmE) 
他们可能有亲属关系。
- I would think/imagine/guess they’ve been waiting for some time.(BrE) 
我猜他们已经等了一段时间。
- I guess that the car has broken down.(NAmE) 
我猜是车抛锚了。
- I think this has probably happened before. 
我觉得这事很可能以前发生过。
- It looks to me as though the woman is very angry. 
我看这女人好像很生气。
- Perhaps/Probably/Possibly/It may be that/Maybe there has been an accident.(BrE or formal, NAmE) 
可能出了事故。
