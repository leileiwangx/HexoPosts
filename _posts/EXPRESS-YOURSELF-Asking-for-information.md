## Asking for information 询问信息
When you want to find something out, it sounds more polite if you can phrase your questions in an indirect way. 用间接的方式询问所需的信息听起来更礼貌：
- Could you tell me the best way to get to Paddington station, please? 
您能告诉我去帕丁顿车站的最佳路线吗？
- Do you happen to know whether Amy Brown works here? 
你可知道艾米 · 布朗是否在这里工作？
- I wonder whether/if you can help me. I’m trying to find out which number to call for reservations. 
不知道您能否帮帮我，我想知道打哪个号码可以预订。
