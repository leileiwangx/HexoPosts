## Making a complaint 提出投诉
You can express your dissatisfaction when something you buy is of poor quality or the standard of service you receive is not good enough in various ways. 对所购劣质商品或得到的低标准服务表达不满可以用多种方式：
- I’m afraid I’m not satisfied with this. 
恐怕我对此不太满意。
- I’m sorry. This isn’t acceptable/good enough. We’ve been waiting half an hour. 
对不起，这是不可接受的。我们已经等半个小时了。
- I’d like to make a complaint. The radio I bought doesn’t work. 
我要投诉。我买的收音机有故障
- Excuse me—this isn’t what I asked for. I’m having/I ordered the soup, not the salad. 
对不起，这不是我点的。我要的是汤，不是色拉。
- I’d like to speak to the manager. I’ve got a complaint about something I bought. 
我要找经理。我对我买的东西不满意。
