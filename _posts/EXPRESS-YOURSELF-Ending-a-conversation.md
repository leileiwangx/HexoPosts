## Ending a conversation 结束谈话
When you stop talking to someone, there are polite ways to end a conversation. 结束与别人的谈话可用比较礼貌的方式：
- It’s been lovely/so nice/good talking to you. 
和你谈谈很开心。
- I’m so glad we got to talk. 
我们有机会谈话，我很高兴。
- I’m sorry, I have to rush off. 
抱歉，我得赶紧走了。
- It was nice to meet you. I’m sorry I have to go now. 
很高兴见到你。对不起，我现在得走了。
- Will you excuse me? There’s someone I’ve got to speak to. 
失陪了，我得跟一个人说几句。
