## Agreeing 表示赞同
In a discussion, people may say certain things which you want to support. (In addition, before you make a negative comment, you may want to say first that there are points that you agree with.)在讨论中可以对某些观点表示支持（另外，在说出负面评价前也可以先对某些观点表示赞同）：
- Yes, that’s true. 
对，的确如此。
- That’s right. On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to the plan… 
没错，但另一方面，这个计划也有一些弊端
- Exactly.

- Absolutely.

- Definitely.

- Yes, I suppose/guess so.

- I agree. It’s definitely the best idea.

- I think you’re right. We should listen to what they have to say.
