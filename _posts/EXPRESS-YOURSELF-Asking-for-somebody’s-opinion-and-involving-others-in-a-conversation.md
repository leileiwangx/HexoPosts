## Asking for somebody’s opinion and involving others in a conversation 征求他人意见和邀请参与谈话
In a meeting or a discussion you may need to find out what other people think. In some exams, you have to show that you can control the conversation by asking for contributions from the examiner. 在会议或讨论中想知道别人的想法，或在某些考试中请主考人发表意见以显示你可以主导谈话，可用以下表达方式：

- I would say it’s OK in the city, but not in the country. What do you think? 
要我说，这在城市里还可以，但在乡村不行。你怎么看？
- My feeling is that we could improve our performance. Do you agree with that? 
我觉得我们可以改善业绩。这么说你同意吗？
- What would you say if we waited another month? 
如果我们再等一个月，你说怎么样？
- What about you? Do you cycle? 
你呢？你会骑自行车吗？
- Which place do you think is more dangerous? 
你认为哪个地方更危险？
- The traffic’s going faster there, isn’t it?/don’t you think? 
那里的交通畅通多了，是不是？ ／你不觉得吗？
- Would you say that traffic’s going faster there? 
你觉得那里的交通更加畅通了吗？
- So this would be a better option, right? (NAmE, informal) 
那么，这会是更好的选择，对吧？
