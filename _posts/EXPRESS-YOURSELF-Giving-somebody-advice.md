## Giving somebody advice 提出建议
There are a number of tactful ways of telling people what you think they should do. 给别人提建议时有一些较为得体的表达方式：
- If I were you, I’d wait. 
如果我是你，我会等等看。
- I think you should/ought to see a doctor. 
我觉得你该去看看医生。
- Why don’t you/Why not/Could you maybe ask Tom to help? 
你为什么不 ／你或许可以找汤姆帮忙？
- If you want my advice/If you want to know what I think, I’d say it’s better to tell him. 
如果你想听我的建议 ／如果你想知道我的想法，我认为最好还是告诉他。
- I’d advise you to sell it now. 
我劝你现在就卖掉它。
